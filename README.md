A few fields needs to be updated by the user before importing it (remove brackets and exclamations marks too):
1. INSERT_NETWORK_SSID_HERE and INSERT_NETWORK_ID_HERE: Change to a known network or delete "NetworkSettings" section and set "RunOnlyIfNetworkAvailable" to false.
2. INSERT_PATH_TO_PY_FLIIP_FOLDER_HERE: Change to proper path on PC where this repository folder is located.
3. INSERT_WINDOWS_USER_ID_HERE: Replace with user "SID". Ref on how to do that here: https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-find-a-users-security-identifier-sid-in-windows-2625149.
